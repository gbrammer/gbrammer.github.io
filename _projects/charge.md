I am currently leading an effort to perform a uniform processing of all archival *Hubble Space Telescope* imaging and slitless spectroscopy observations relevant for studying distant galaxies (e.g., reasonably high galactic latitudes, avoiding large foreground galaxies, including WFC3/IR).

*Full data release forthcoming.*

Preliminary imaging mosaics of the CANDELS survey fields including are available below, which include all available ACS/WFC, WFC3/UVIS, and WFC3/IR observations and are precisely aligned to the GAIA DR2 frame.

[CANDELS](https://s3.amazonaws.com/grizli-v1/Mosaics/index.html) - AEGIS, GOODS-N, GOODS-S, and UDS fields

[COSMOS](https://s3.amazonaws.com/grizli-cosmos-v2/Mosaics/cosmos-v2.html) - ACS + WFC3 mosaics of the entire square-degree COSMOS field.

With a generous allocation of *Spitzer* DDT time in 2019, we are acquiring IRAC imaging of hundreds of extragalactic *HST* archival fields that are amenable to detecting galaxies at z>8 ([Spitzer-DDT-14253](https://sha.ipac.caltech.edu/applications/Spitzer/SHA/#id=SearchByProgram&RequestClass=ServerRequest&DoSearch=true&SearchByProgram.field.program=14253), Co-PI Mauro Stefanon @ Leiden).
